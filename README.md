# hello-everybody
This is just a noob start for myself

This is Wayne Sau, it's the first time after 15 years I last put my hands on stuff like this. 
The last program I did was a staff appraisal site build from vb.net

And now, I am committing to get involve with the team to cut down their workload on operation in MV.
